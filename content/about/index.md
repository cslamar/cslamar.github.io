Chris Slamar is a thirty-something Unix geek that currently lives near Chicago, Illinois and works for [Hologram](https://hologram.io/)

When not at work I enjoy music, reading, tinkering, and doing computer related tasks that most would categorize as work related.

I'm married to the lovely Kristina, my wonderful wife who helps keep me sane(ish)!  She is also in charge of editing my horrible spelling, so please direct any mistakes you may find on this site to [grammar-nazi@slamar.com](mailto:grammar-nazi@slamar.com)

When it comes to electronics, my interests are wide. If it plugs in, I love it!  Technology (and all the various things come with it) is my passion. Iâ€™ve set up a multitude of network services over the years, and have written various projects to explore all aspects of the technological world.

**Fun Fact**: I used to do support and development for an open source project, from 2005 to 2009, called [Ampache](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/) which you should check out!
